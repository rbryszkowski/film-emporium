Hi Steve and Chris,

This is my attempt at the task you gave me, its pretty basic but I think it fulfils all the functionality you asked for.

There were a few things I would have liked to have added/tweaked but I didn't have time in the end.

For example, when submitting a search query, you have to type in the information exactly as it appears in the database, with the correct capitalization etc.

If I had more time I would have used regular expressions so the search would be case insensitive and also allow for duplicate characters, and other common typos.

I would also have made the interface prettier, and used a datalist for the search input so that autocomplete would assist with queries.

Also I'm not quite sure how to have the database start from ID 1 when you delete everything and subsequently add more films, I looked everywhere in the documentation and nothing about this was mentioned.

I will still work on this and make improvements but I hope you are happy with my work so far.

Take care,

Remy
